                    <h4>Difference Between Bill Register and Bill Statement</h4>
                    <p>
                        The <strong>Bill Register</strong> displays all bills <u>individually</u>, allowing for detailed
                        inspection and <strong>printing of each separate bill</strong>.
                        In contrast, the <strong>Bill Statement</strong> consolidates bills under their respective
                        <em>parties (clients)</em>, enabling <strong>grouped viewing</strong> and <strong>bulk
                            printing</strong>.
                        In summary, the <strong>Register page</strong> focuses on <u>individual job-level billing
                            records</u>, while the <strong>Statement page</strong> emphasizes <u>party-level billing
                            summaries</u>.
